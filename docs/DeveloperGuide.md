## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both EstateEase data (including `Buyer`, `Seller`, and `House`) and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit Buyer

#### Purpose
The `editBuyer` command allows users to edit the details an existing `Buyer` in EstateEase.

#### Implementation

<puml src="diagrams/EditBuyerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditBuyerSequenceDiagram" width="1200"/>

1. The user enters the `editBuyer` command in the format `editBuyer INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL]
[type/HOUSING_TYPE] [budget/BUDGET]` (E.g. editBuyer 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com).
2. The input is then passed to the `AddressBookParser` which calls `EditBuyerCommandParser.parse()` to parse the input.
   If the input is invalid, this method will throw a `ParseException`, prompting the user where the invalid input went
   wrong.
3. `EditBuyerCommandParser.parse()` will create an `editBuyerDescriptor` object if the input is valid.
    The `editBuyerDescriptor` object contains the edited values of the `Buyer`.
    `EditBuyerCommandParser.parse()` will then return an `EditBuyerCommand` object which contains the `INDEX` of the
    `Buyer` and `editBuyerDescriptor`.
4. The logic manager will then `execute()` of the `EditBuyerCommand` object.
5. In the `execute()`, the system will check if the `INDEX` is valid, check if the object being edited is of `Buyer`
   type, and check if the edited `name` value already exists in EstateEase. If any of these checks fail, a
   `CommandException` will be thrown.
6. Once the checks are all done, the system will construct a new `Buyer` object which contains the edited values. This
   object will then be used to update the model through `setPerson()` method of `model`.

#### Design Considerations
It is important to ensure that the target of the `editBuyer` command is in fact a `Buyer` object as it has different
parameters that is not available to `Seller` object. Hence, the reason why the edit command is also separated into two
commands, one for buyer and one for seller. The uniqueness of the `name` value in the EstateEase is also
needed as some of the commands uses the `name` to execute the command.

### Edit Seller

#### Purpose
The `editSeller` command allows user to edit the details of an existing `Seller` in EstateEase.

#### Implementation
The overall implementation of this command is very similar to `editBuyer` command, except the command format is
`editSeller [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL]` (E.g. editSeller 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com).

### Matching Sellers to a Buyer

#### Purpose

The real estate agent may want to obtain all houses from sellers that match the buyer's preferences. For example, the real estate agent may want to gather all houses from sellers that align with a specified buyer's budget and preferred housing type.

#### Implementation

1. The `MatchBuyerCommand` class extends the `Command` class and is responsible for executing the matching process. It expects the full name of the `Buyer` to be specified in the command input. Upon execution, the command retrieves the `Budget` and `HousingType` of the specified buyer. It then matches these preferences with the listings of available sellers' houses.

2. The `MatchBuyerCommandParser` class is used to parse the user input and create the `MatchBuyerCommand` object. When executed by the `LogicManager`, the `MatchBuyerCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called. This method matches the buyer's preferences with available sellers' houses in the model and returns a `CommandResult` object.

#### Example Usage Scenario:

**Step 1:** The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state (consisting of both `Buyer` and `Seller` details).

**Step 2:** The user executes the `matchBuyer Alice Lim` command to find and display `Seller` details with `House` that match the preferences of the buyer named "Alice Lim" in the `AddressBook`.

**Note:** If the `matchBuyer` command is used without specifying the full name of a `Buyer`, it will return a message to the user indicating that the buyer does not exist.


The following sequence diagram shows how an `matchBuyer` operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/MatchBuyerSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="MatchBuyerSequenceDiagram-Logic" width="1200"/>

#### Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use a new `MatchBuyerCommand` to do matching.
    * Pros:
        * Provides a dedicated command specifically tailored for matching sellers to a `Buyer`, enhancing clarity and readability in the codebase.
        * Allows for specialized handling of buyer matching logic within its own command class, facilitating easier maintenance and updates.
    * Cons:
        * Requires the introduction of a new command class, potentially increasing the overall complexity of the codebase.
        * More commands for the user to remember
* *Alternative 2:* Use prefix in `FindCommand` to do matching
    * Pros:
        * Utilizes an existing command class, reducing the need for additional code and command classes dedicated to matching.
        * Leverages the flexibility of the `FindCommand` structure to accommodate various matching scenarios with different prefixes.
    * Cons:
        * May lead to less clear and focused command implementations, as matching logic would be mixed with other find functionalities.
        * Could result in increased complexity within the `FindCommand` class, potentially making it harder to maintain and understand.

### \[Proposed\] Add seller feature

#### Purpose
This `addSeller` feature allows user to add a `Seller` and a `House` into the EstateEase

#### Example Usage Scenario
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `addSeller` command

<puml src="diagrams/AddSellerActivityDiagram.puml" width="500" />

#### Implementation
The following sequence diagram shows how an `addSeller` operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSellerSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="AddSellerSequenceDiagram-Logic" width="1200"/>

The proposed add seller mechanism is facilitated by `Person`. It extends `Person` with additional field `House`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `Seller#addHouse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Add a house to the seller list of houses.
* `Seller#removeHouse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Remove a list of houses from the seller.
* `Seller#getHouses()`â€‰â€”â€‰Get a list of houses from the seller.
* `Seller#hasHouse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Check if a house in a list of houses from the seller.
* `Seller#copy()`â€‰â€”â€‰Values of the seller is copied to a new seller object.

**Details:**
1. The `AddSellerCommand` class extends the `Command` class and is responsible for executing the add seller process. It expects the full name of the `Seller` and the full details of the `House` to be specified in the command input.
2. Upon execution, the command will then be parsed to `execute()` in `LogicManager`.
3. The command will then be parsed to `parseCommand()` in `AddressBookParser`.
4. The argument which contains a `Seller` and a `House` will then be parsed to `parse()` in `AddSellerCommandParser`.
5. The `House` will then be checked at the `checkValidity()` in `AddHouseCommandParser`.
6. If all the arguments for a `Seller` and a `House` is valid, it will then be parsed to the `AddSellerCommand`, where a constructor will be created.
7. At the `AddSellerCommand`, it will check whether there is duplicate `Seller` in `Person`, `Seller` and `Buyer` cannot be the same `Person`. The `House` will also be checked to see whether it is a duplicate `House`, since the same `House` should not exist in the EstateEase data.
8. Once the checks are all done, a `CommandResult` will then be returned. The system will then construct a new `Seller` object which contains the `Seller` details and `House` details. This object will then be used to update the `Model` through `addPerson()` method of model.

**Note:**
- If the `Seller` has the same name as a `Seller` or a `Buyer`, it will return an error to the user that the `Person` has existed. Each `Buyer` and `Seller` are unique, and `Buyer` cannot be a `Seller`, and vice versa.
- If there is a duplicate `House` in the EstateEase, it will return an error to the user that the should `House` has existed. Each `House` is unique, and there should not be duplicates.

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How `addSeller` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a new command to add `Seller`.
    * **Pros:** Easy to implement, lesser confusion on adding `Seller` and `Buyer`.
    * **Cons:** May lead to many commands, which is difficult for user to remember.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a prefix to differentiate between `Seller` and `Buyer`.
    * **Pros:** Having lesser commands is easier for the user to remember.
    * **Cons:** Difficult to implement, having more prefixes means more validation.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

#### Why It's Implemented That Way
- The edit function is separated out into Buyer and Seller as each Buyer and Seller have a minor difference in their attributes.

#### Adding Houses

### Purpose

The `AddHouse` Command is necessary to allow Houses to be added to Sellers.

### Implementation

The `AddHouseCommand` class extends the `Command` class and is responsible for executing the adding of a house to a seller. It expects the full name of the seller to be specified in the command input, along with the full details of the house. Upon execution, the command fetches listings of available sellers' houses. It checks if the house already exists and if the seller is a valid seller. If it does not exist and the seller is valid, the house is added to the seller.

The `AddHouseCommandParser` class is used to parse the user input and create the `AddHouseCommand` object. When executed by the `LogicManager`, the `AddHouseCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called. This method checks if the seller exists and if the house already exists and if the house is valid and returns a `CommandResult` object.

### Example Usage Scenario:

**Step 1:** The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` is assumed to already have the `Seller` John Doe.

**Step 2:** The user executes the `addHouse n/John Doe type/Condominium street/Clementi Ave 2 blk/N/A level/02 unitNo/25 postal/578578 price/99999 ` command to add a `House` with these details to `AddressBook`.

**Note:** If the `addHouse` command is used with a `Person` who is not a `Seller`, or with invalid house details, or to a nonexistent `Seller`, or an already existing `House`, an error message is displayed.


The following sequence diagram shows how an `matchBuyer` operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/AddHouseSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="AddHouseSequenceDiagram-Logic" width="1200"/>

### Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use only a `Houses` ArrayList within Sellers to track
    * Pros:
        * Allows for only seller handling for houses and reduces overlap within classes
        * Easier to track house logic as it will be contained within the seller
    * Cons:
        * Need to check all sellers whenever houses are checked for duplicates. increasing runtime

#### Deleting Houses

### Purpose

The `DeleteHouse` Command is necessary to delete Houses from relevant Sellers.

### Implementation

The `DeleteHouseCommand` class extends the `Command` class and is responsible for executing the deletion of a house from a seller. It expects the full name of the seller to be specified in the command input, along with the full details of the house. Upon execution, the command fetches listings of available sellers' houses. It checks if the house already exists and if the seller is a valid seller. If it does exist and the seller is valid, the house is deleted from the seller.

The `DeleteHouseCommandParser` class is used to parse the user input and create the `DeleteHouseCommand` object. When executed by the `LogicManager`, the `DeleteHouseCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called. This method checks if the seller exists and if the house already exists and if the house is valid and returns a `CommandResult` object.

### Example Usage Scenario:

**Step 1:** The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` is assumed to already have the `Seller` John Doe. John Doe is assumed to have a Condominium located at Clementi Ave 2, level 2 (with no block), unit number 25, postal code 578578 with price 99999.

**Step 2:** The user executes the `deleteHouse n/John Doe type/Condominium street/Clementi Ave 2 blk/N/A level/02 unitNo/25 postal/578578 price/99999 ` command to delete a `House` with these details from `AddressBook` and John Doe's houses.

**Note:** If the `deleteHouse` command is used with a `Person` who is not a `Seller`, or with invalid house details, or to a nonexistent `Seller`, or an already existing `House` not under the named `Seller`, an error message is displayed.


The following sequence diagram shows how an `deleteHouse` operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteHouseSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="DeleteHouseSequenceDiagram-Logic" width="1200"/>

### Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use only a `Houses` ArrayList within Sellers to track
    * Pros:
        * Allows for only seller handling for houses and reduces overlap within classes
        * Easier to track house logic as it will be contained within the seller
    * Cons:
        * Need to check all sellers whenever houses are checked for duplicates. increasing runtime


### \[Proposed\] Add buyer feature

#### Proposed Implementation

This feature aims to facilitate the process of adding buyer to EstateEase.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add buyer behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state (consisting of both `Buyer` and `Seller` details).

Step 2: The user executes the `addBuyer n/Ben ...` command to add one `Buyer`.

Step 3: After the user add `Buyer` to EstateEase, it will then be displayed in the list of `Person`.

**Note:** If the `Buyer` has the same name as a `Seller` or a `Buyer`, it will return an error to the user that the person has existed. Each `Buyer` and `Seller` are unique, and `Buyer` cannot be a `Seller`, and vice versa.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How `addBuyer` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a new command to add `Buyer`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, lesser confusion on adding `Seller` and `Buyer`.
    * Cons: May lead to many commands, which is difficult for user to remember.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a prefix to differentiate between `Seller` and `Buyer`
  itself.
    * Pros: Having lesser commands is easier for the user to remember.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement, having more prefixes means more validation.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
